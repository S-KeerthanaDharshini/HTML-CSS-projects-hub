        <h3>Setting the Darkness and A Spark of Change</h3>
        <p><strong>Review:</strong> <span style="color: gold;">★★★★☆</span></p>
        <p>In the quiet corners of a small town, a young woman named Lira battles invisible storms grief, 
            failure, and a sense of being lost after losing her mother and her dream of becoming a writer. 
            Each day feels heavier than the last, and the world, once full of color, now seems muted. 
            Her days are a repetition of silence and self-doubt, and she begins to believe that she is broken beyond repair. 
            Her creative spirit feels buried under the weight of her pain.One morning, while walking aimlessly, Lira stumbles upon her mother's old garden, overgrown and wild. 
            </p>
           <p> Something about its messiness speaks to her. With trembling hands, she begins to clear a small patch, 
            not knowing why just needing to do something. As she works, memories come flooding back, and with each 
            weed she pulls, she feels a small release. She starts journaling again, just a few lines a day, letting 
            her buried voice resurface.Weeks pass, and the garden begins to shift. So does Lira. She keeps showing up for the soil, for the pages, 
            for herself.</p>

            <p>The pain doesn’t disappear, but it transforms. Her grief becomes a wellspring for words. 
                    She writes honestly, vulnerably, and her story once something she ran from becomes her strength. 
                    She shares her first blog post anonymously. It resonates. She’s not alone, and neither are her readers.
                    Months later, the garden blooms in full color, and so does Lira. She publishes her first collection titled 
                    “Shadows Grow Flowers Too”, a tribute to healing and becoming. </p>
